### Growth implies change

I like to find out what motivates us as humans and how we can keep it up. Previously, I developed software, created communities, taught classes at various institutions, gave workshops, mentored dozens of people, and managed Engineering teams at Red Hat and other companies. Increasing age and number fingers have led me away from gaming, back to [Blender](https://www.blender.org/), [GIMP](https://www.gimp.org/), and [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/).

Currently, I develop open source software at [Red Hat](https://redhat.com) and research at [TU Berlin](https://tu.berlin). Most of my engineering activities flow into the following two projects and their communities.

### Three Book Recommendations

[The End of Average](https://www.harpercollins.com/products/the-end-of-average-todd-rose) is a book about character and how humanity, especially in recent centuries, has focused more on averages than on context and individualism. Lots of examples and in-depth observations.

[Managing Humans](https://www.apress.com/gp/book/9781484221570) is one of the few books on people management that doesn't make you fall asleep. It's funny, accurate, and teaches you a lot about management - both up and down. Great read - no matter what role you're currently in.

[Happiness: A Guide to Developing Life's Most Important Skill](https://www.matthieuricard.org/en/books/happiness-a-guide-to-developing-life-s-most-important-skill) contains some verbal gems - read about brain waves, altruism, and Matthieu's fascinating life journey.

### Three Video Recommendations

[What Are You Doing With Your Life? The Tail End](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JXeJANDKwDc) is yet another wonderful creation by Kurzgesagt visualizing your life span and how you're spending it.

[Quit social media | Dr. Cal Newport](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3E7hkPZ-HTk) might convince you one way or another if you're on the edge about whether you should stay on your social media platform(s) of choice.

["If you value your lives, be somewhere else"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtNtw2HTFtA) is one of my favorite quotes from any movies, series, and books ever.
